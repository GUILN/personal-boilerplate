# Personal Boilerplate

### Consider this an spike, so tests and any other improvements will be set later

# How to run
1 - your personal access token for your github to be contained in the `B_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable

2 - Initiate the venv and pip install dependencies

3 - `CD` into `SRC` folder and Run `Python3 main.py`

# Install and configure
Please to install run:
- `install.sh` (not the best way but it still useful)
- Remember to export environment variables:
    B_PLATE_ACCESS_TOKEN (your github Personal Access Token)
    B_PLATE_REPO_NAME => Your boilerplate repo name (can be private)
- Set the path contained in `install.sh` to `PATH` 
- Set the hashbang to the `/src/boilerplate.py` 
- Rename `/src/boilerplate.py` to `/src/boilerplate.py` 

# Your boilerplate repo published on git should have folders containg: 
`.boilerplate` file, to indicate that the folder contains a boilerplate 

# NOTE
There is a lot of room to improve this repo.
It is just a very simple tool I personaly use (and I expect to expend more time here improving)
